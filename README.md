**Vanity-BTC cannot and will never store your private key**, and if you don't trust it, you have 3 ways to ensure your key remains private:  
- Once the web page is loaded, you can turn off the internet and continue playing, it will work seamlessly  
- You can also download the latest build of Vanity-BTC  [here](https://github.com/Joshua-Zou/vanity-btc)  and use it on a completely offline computer  
- The code is 100% open source and available on  [Github](https://github.com/Universal-monetization). You can review it as much as you want before using it 
- You can [download](https://github.com/Joshua-Zou/vanity-btc/releases/tag/v1.3.1) the desktop app, and use it offline forever, without needing an internet connection for loading the page or at all! 
  

## Performance

For some reason, the performance of Vanity-BTC can vary a lot from a browser to another. Currently, The Desktop App provides the best results with the most security, but for browsers, chrome comes in at a close second.  
Using Vanity-BTC on your phone or tablet will work, but don't expect to reach the speed of a good old (super) computer.

## Compatibility

Any address generated with Vanity-BTC is can be used as any normal wallet!
